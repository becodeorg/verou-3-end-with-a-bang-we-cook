We Cook
With ‘We Cook’ we’re looking to find a simple solution for busy people when choosing recipes.
On the website you can easily select recipes or get the website to randomly select for you.
This way you can plan your meals ahead of time.
The selected recipes will generate a shopping list for the user
While the user is out grocery shopping they can conveniently access the shopping list from their phone.
